# Elm Licenses

**alpha**

Simple CLI tool for reporting licenses of Elm dependencies.

## Runtime Dependecies

Just Node.js (and curl if you will ran it as I do).

## Usage

This tool is primary meant to be used by CI pipelines.

```
$ curl -L https://github.com/turboMaCk/elm-licenses/releases/download/0.1.0/index.js | node
```
